How vagianal species should be selected to build a vaginal speciateIT DB?



A possible strategy


Use ASV files from several project.

For each ASV file generated 'cos' metric embedding of ASV relative abundance profiles.

Cluster ASV's using the above embeddings.

Take the longest sequence in each cluster as a representative of that cluster.

Gather all these cluster represenetative ASVs from all projects and create a fasta file of the corresponding sequences.

Run speciateIT on that file no-error-threshold flag

Create a list of the resulting tentative vaginal species

Use the tentative vaginal species to generate a sIT DB of input files for creation of sIT MC models

Run sp_model_seq_lpps on the DB

Identify species or species clusters using pp of model sequence distributions

Hi Jacques,

Using 21 projects worth of data, there are relatively fewer species present in
100% of projects, as expected, and as the prevalence of species decrease, so do
the number of ASVs that they represent.

If we required species to be present in at least 20% of projects, there would be
802 species, 30% would be 542 species, and 40% would be 431 species. Species
such as Gemella_sanguinis, Megasphaera_massiliensis, Prevotella_buccae, and
Mycoplasma_genitalium are present in only ~28% of projects. Below this value,
there are not many species we would be expect in the vagina. Given this, I
propose we round down to 25% which would result in 651 species. It will take a
little testing from here to see how the models do, but I believe this is a good
starting place.

Best,
Johanna
