find . -executable -type f >>.gitignore

If you don't care about ordering of lines in your .gitignore, you could also update your .gitignore with the following command which also removes duplicates and keeps alphabetic ordering intact.

T=$(mktemp); (cat .gitignore; find . -executable -type f | sed -e 's%^\./%%') | sort | uniq >$T; mv $T .gitignore
